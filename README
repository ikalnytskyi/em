                    empasize expressions in the stdout

    ~ What is em?

      em program is a terminal tool that prints FILE(s), or standard input
      to standard output and highlights the expressions that are matched
      the PATTERN.

      The expression will be highlighted iff stdout refers to the terminal
      and that terminal is ANSI-compatible.


    ~ Why the name em?

      The name is an abbreviation of emphasize, a synonym of highlight.
      BTW, it's easy to write and it's easy to remember since HTML has
      <em> tag with similar meaning.


    ~ Requirements?

      The terminal must be ANSI-compatible. This criterion is met by
      most popular terminal emulators on Linux, Unix and MacOS.


    ~ How to install?

        $ (sudo) pip install em


    ~ How to use?

      The most practical usecase for me:

        $ tail -f /path/to/log | em "ERROR|CRITICAL" RED
